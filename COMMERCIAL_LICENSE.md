# Commercial Licensing Information

This software is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3)**.

This license ensures that the software remains free and open source. However, if you would like to use this software in a **proprietary, closed-source, or commercial** context without being bound by the terms of the AGPL, a **commercial license** is available.

## Why a Commercial License?

The AGPL requires that:
- Any modifications to this software must be open-sourced when distributed.
- If the software is used over a network (e.g., as part of a SaaS product), the source code must be made available to users.

If these conditions are incompatible with your business or deployment model, you may obtain a commercial license which grants you the rights to:

- Use the software in proprietary systems
- Modify and integrate it without disclosing your source code
- Include it in commercial products without AGPL obligations
